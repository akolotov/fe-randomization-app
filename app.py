### General Game Mat description

The game mat is a square with dimensions of 3 meters by 3 meters, divided
into 9 equal sections, each sized 1 meter by 1 meter. The sections are
organized as follows:

1. **Corner Sections**:
    - There are 4 corner sections, located in the four outer corners of
    the mat. These sections are referred to as "C" in the schematic below.

2. **Straightforward Sections**:
    - There are 4 straightforward sections, which are linear and connect
    opposite corners. These sections are positioned as:

        - 2 horizontal straightforward sections (one above and one below the
        central section).
        - 2 vertical straightforward sections (one to the left and one to the
        right of the central section).

    - These sections are referred to as "S" in the schematic.

3. **Central Section**:
    - The middle section is non-functional and serves as the
    **central section**. This area is referred to as "###" in the schematic
    and remains unused during gameplay.

**Pseudographic Representation of the Game Mat**

To visually aid the understanding of the layout, hereâ€™s a pseudographic
representation of the game mat:

```
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
| C | S | C |
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
| S |###| S |
|   |###|   |  Central Section (###)
|   |###|   |  (Unused during gameplay)
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
| C | S | C |
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
```

**Important Notes:**

- The game mat consists only of the sections described above, with no built-in
walls or obstacles.

- **Walls**: Outer and inner walls are additional game elements that are
placed around or on the mat during the game, but they are not part of the mat
itself.

- The **outer walls** typically run along the edges of the mat, while
**inner walls** can be configured in various ways, potentially enclosing the
central section, but these walls are separate from the mat structure.

**Labels for the straightforward sections**

- The section at the top is labeled "Section N"
- The section at the bottom is labeled "Section S"
- The section on the left is labeled "Section W"
- The section on the right is labeled "Section E"

```

### Straightforward Section Layout Description

Each straightforward section on the game mat has a structured layout,
featuring the following elements:

1. **Radiuses**:
    - There are **three radiuses** within each straightforward section:

        - **Two radiuses** run vertically along the **left and right edges**
        of the section. They extend from the central section (top) toward the
        outer part of the field (bottom).

        - **One central radius** is positioned in the **middle** of the
        section, running vertically from the top to the bottom of the section.

    - These radiuses divide the section into two columns of zones.

2. **Arcs**:
    - There are **two arcs** that run horizontally across the section:

        - The arcs are positioned at two levels, creating divisions across the
        section horizontally.

        - These arcs do not connect the corner sections but instead divide the
        section into multiple zones horizontally.

3. **Intersections**:
    - The layout of radiuses and arcs forms multiple intersections, which can
    be used to place obstacles such as traffic signs:

        - **4 T-intersections**: These occur where the arcs meet the radiuses.

        - **2 X-intersections**: These occur where the central radius
        intersects with the arcs.

    - Each intersection is a potential location for placing obstacles that
    vehicles must navigate during the game.

4. **Zones**:

    - The combination of the two arcs and three radiuses divides the
    straightforward section into **6 zones**:

        - **Top and bottom zones** are taller and provide more space.

        - **Middle zones** are shorter, as they are compressed by the arcs.

    - These zones serve as key areas for gameplay, where obstacles can be
    placed or specific actions may occur.

**Pseudographic Representation of the Straightforward Section:**

```

|   |   |
+---+---+ - arc
|   |   |
|   |   |
|   |   |
+---+---+
    ^
    radius
```

In this schematic:

- The three radiuses (left, right, and middle) run vertically from the outer
part of the game field (at the top) to the central section (at the bottom).

- The two arcs divide the section horizontally into three rows of zones, with
the middle row being shorter than the top and bottom rows.

- The intersections formed by the radiuses and arcs serve as key locations for
obstacle placement.

**Labels for the Intersection Points**

- Intersection points in the top row are labeled "T4", "X2", and "T3" from
left to right.

- Intersection points in the bottom row are labeled "T2", "X1", and "T1" from
left to right.

**Labels for the zones**

- Zones in the top row are labeled "Z6" and "Z5"
- Zones in the middle row are labeled "Z4" and "Z3"
- Zones in the bottom row are labeled "Z2" and "Z1"
